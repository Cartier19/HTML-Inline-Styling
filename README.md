# HTML-Inline-Styling

So basically, I just decided to test myself or should I say Challenge myself by building a website template using HTML only.
it wasn't an easy process but it was fun doing it, and I feel it came out well.
Used VSCODE and at times thought I was getting errors until I saw that most inline styling were deprecated but I still continued with them anyway and finally got what I desired.
It may not be a perfect design but it's a great start if you ask me
This project took me 3 weeks to complete majorly because I had to stop in between to be able to focus on school.
